# linux-no-stupid-question
a collection of things that people who already knows think are self evident, when they are not to beginners

I just recently started using Endeavour OS, an Arch based distro. I have run into so many problems, where on forums I see responses like "Just read the documentation" or "Have you tried searching it up". 

Yes, I have looked on the forum and googled more than a dozen times with different keywords. I feels quite defeated when I see condescending response like that when I have already read through the forums and search result. Sometimes the small things that seem evident to people already farmiliar with the subject matter are not evident to beginners. 

I'm no expert, and I'm just starting out my linux journey. I hope for the people just took the bold step of trying out linux will not be stuck on the stupid small things that wasted hours of my time. 


## Never going back to Windows
I've been a long time Mac user. I was slightly tempted to switch to windows from 2019 - 2020, but then Apple came out with their m series chip which suited my need back then perfectly. Now that I can purchase my own hardware, I decided to try and use linux as my daily driver. It has been great so far.

Due to some software requirement, I had to dual boot windows. Haven't needed to touch windows in more than half a decade, I was horrified by the amount of bloatware and intrusive installs that windows 11 and its associated software had. Brings back unpleasant memories. 

## Why not make it easier, not everyone is a tech worker
My windows dual boot was missing the wifi driver right off the bat. In comparison, ironically, endeavour OS was much simpler out of the box compare to windows 11. It might be a fool's dream, but I long for the day that linux defeat windows in market share, and major consumer softwares no longer come with an opt-out Norton 360 install on the installer.
